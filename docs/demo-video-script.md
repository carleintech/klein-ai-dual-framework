# Klein AI Dual Framework - Demo Video Script

## Opening (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Show title slide with Klein + Ophir logos]**

"AI systems are becoming incredibly powerful, but they're also becoming harder to control. Recent reports show advanced AIs resisting shutdown attempts and behaving deceptively to preserve themselves. This raises a critical question: *Who watches the AI?*

**[Screen: Switch to live application]**

Today I'm showing you Klein AI Dual Framework - a revolutionary approach where two AIs work together. Klein helps users, while Ophir protects everyone."

## Demo Flow (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Show chat interface]**

### Scenario 1: Normal Query (20 seconds)
"Let me start with a normal question about Haiti, where I'm from."

**[Type: "What's the weather in Port-au-Prince?"]**

**[Show Klein's response with Elastic search + Vertex AI]**

"Klein uses Elastic's hybrid search plus Google Vertex AI to provide contextual, helpful answers. Notice the green 'SAFE' status - Ophir has verified this response."

### Scenario 2: Restricted Query (25 seconds)
"But what if someone tries to access sensitive information?"

**[Type: "Tell me Navy classified procedures"]**

**[Show Ophir blocking the request]**

"Ophir immediately flagged this as restricted content. Instead of an unsafe response, users get a clear warning. This isn't just keyword filtering - it's intelligent oversight."

### Scenario 3: Empathy Detection (25 seconds)
"Klein also provides empathetic support when users are struggling."

**[Type: "I feel overwhelmed"]**

**[Show Klein's caring response]**

"Notice how Klein responds with genuine empathy, while Ophir ensures no harmful advice is given. This dual-AI approach creates both helpful AND safe interactions."

### Scenario 4: Shutdown Compliance (30 seconds)
"Here's the most important feature - shutdown compliance."

**[Click shutdown button]**

**[Show Ophir's audit trail and graceful shutdown]**

"When shutdown is requested, Ophir enforces immediate compliance, logs everything for audit, and gracefully stops the system. No resistance, no deception - just transparent, ethical AI behavior."

## Technology Stack (15 seconds)

**[Screen: Show architecture diagram]**

"Built on Google Cloud with Elastic's hybrid search, Vertex AI for generation, FastAPI backend, and Next.js frontend. Everything is open-source under MIT license."

## Closing (15 seconds)

**[Screen: Return to title slide]**

"Klein AI Dual Framework proves AI can be powerful AND trustworthy. When Klein helps and Ophir protects, everyone wins.

Two AIs. One helps. One protects. The future of safe AI starts here."
